# IRT Simulation and Recovery

This projects analizes some Item Response Theory models by simulating data and recovering the parameter values that generated them.

## Notes to myself

Still not sure how to structure the whole thing: initially I was thinking of a folder for data and another for inference, but now I'm considering opening a folder for each model. I guess some mixture of both could work, as the main goals are both to understand each model separately, but also to evaluate different inference (model selection) techniques working with a single dataset.
